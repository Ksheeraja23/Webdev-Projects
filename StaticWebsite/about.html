            <h2>Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service)</h2>
            <h4><em>- The beginning of the role in technology</em></h4>
            <p>While teaching in Vassar College, Grace Hopper came across the Navy and wanted to join it. So she attempted to join it but unfortunately faced rejection for three reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Her height and weight were below the required standards.</li>
                <li>She was older than the required age category (she was 34 at that time)</li>
                <li>As it was during the onset of World War II, her role as a professor in Vassar College was considered crucial for the war support.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In 1943, She managed to secure a leave from Vassar College and joined the United States Navy Reserve, volunteering to serve in the Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service). A year post joining the WAVES, she received commission as a Junior Grade Lieutenant  and then, was assigned to the Bureau of Ordinace Computation Project at Harvard University. Here, her team contributed to the development of Mark I, which was an early computer prototype. During this period, she authored a manual of operations for the Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator, which outlines the foundational principles of computing machines. Besides this, while working on Mark I, she introduced us to the term “bug” to describe a computer malfunction; a term we still use till date.</p>

            <p>Mark I computer, being the first ever prototype of a functional programming computer, made at Harvard University, operated continuously on military assignments, undertaking extensive computations for massive mathematical tables. Its primary contribution was to the Navy, where it played a crucial role in generating tables for designing equipment like torpedoes and underwater detection systems. Additionally, its use was sought by the other military branches for calculations related to the design of surveillance camera lenses, radar systems and implosion devices for the atomic bomb within the Manhattan Project. These mathematical tables generated by Mark I computer were groundbreaking as they were the first to be printed by the machine's output, eliminating any human error.</p>
            <p>The reason Grace was given for her rejection in the Navy, I.e, her role as a professor was considered more crucial for the war; she implemented her mathematical skills and integrated in the defence forces, creating a machine that helped the U.S military with war support. One of the notable achievements of the computer is a project involving a set of differential equations known as Bessel Functions, giving the computer the nickname “Bessie”. This highlights the computer's significance, the beginning of Hopper's career and lasting impact on military applications during that era.</p>

            <h2>UNIVAC</h2>
            <p>After a period of time, Grace requested a regular position in the Navy. Albeit her contributions, she was rejected because of her age. After this, she decided to depart from Harvard as well due to the lack of opportunities for promotion or tenure; they were limited.</p>
            <p>By 1949, she joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (which was later acquired by Remington Rand) in Philadelphia as a senior mathematician. This company had a pivotal role in creating the first electronic computer, ENIAC, under military contracts.
                During this period in Philadelphia, she engaged in some of her most impactful work. She served as the chief programmer for Remington Rand and played a key role in the development of UNIVAC I (UNIVersal Automatic Computer). In 1952, her programming team reached a milestone by creating the first computer language referred to as “complier”, which was named A-0. 
                These compliers translated mathematical code into machine readable binary code, allowing the creation of programs for multiple computers with the help of these compliers. Her team worked further and developed Flow-Matic and Math-Matic, marking the advent of the first programming languages which used commands akin to everyday english. She believed that the use of word based programming languages would enhance the comfort of data processors who typically were not mathematicians or engineers.</p>
            <p>In the 1980 conversation, she explained, "I wanted to make computers accessible to more people by starting with English language programming. I always pushed for languages that are easier for regular users. A lot of the material we get from scholars and computer experts isn't really suitable for everyday users."
               UNIVAC had a big impact on how people saw computers, marking a moment when computers became more widely known. Created by John Mauchly and Presper Eckert, who also made ENIAC, UNIVAC was a flexible and general-purpose machine. In 1946, Mauchly and Eckert suggested a statistical tabulator to the U.S. Census Bureau, and by 1951, UNIVAC I passed the tests.
               UNIVAC used seven mercury delay-line tanks for memory, which was advanced for its time. Years later, Mauchly and Eckert brought back UNIVAC to work on census statistics, showing it was still relevant. The company Remington Rand sold two UNIVAC I computers to the Census Bureau.
               But instead of using UNIVAC for the entire population count, the Bureau used it for a smaller business-related census. Because UNIVAC couldn't store a lot of data, analyzing text required many tape reels to keep the needed information secure.</p>

            <h2>COBOL</h2>
            <p>Hopper articulated that her A-0 compiler was designed to "translate mathematical notation into machine code." While symbol manipulation was suitable for mathematicians, it proved impractical for data processors who lacked expertise in symbol manipulation—a skill predominantly mastered by professional mathematicians. Hopper asserted that the majority find it more accessible to compose statements in English than to engage with symbolic representation.</p>
            <p>This marked the genesis of COBOL, a computer language tailored for data processors, currently recognized as a predominant language in the field of data processing.</p>
            <p>In 1959, experts gathered at CODASYL. Hopper advised the committee, and her team helped define COBOL. It combined her FLOW-MATIC with ideas from IBM's COMTRAN. Hopper thought programs should be written in a language close to English, not machine code. COBOL became the primary business language. Jean E. Sammet, a Mount Holyoke College graduate, was on the committee.
               From 1967 to 1977, Hopper directed the Navy Programming Languages Group and became a captain in 1973. She created validation software for COBOL as part of a Navy standardization effort.</p>
