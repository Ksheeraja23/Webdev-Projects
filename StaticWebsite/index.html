            <h1>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper: the talented "COBOL Grandma"</h1>
            <p><em>Her talent was noticed when she would dismantle clocks and fixed them in such a way that they ran backwards. With the clock's reference, she quoted - "Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, "We've always done it this way." I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.‚Äù</em></p>

            <h2>Grace Hopper's history in the contributions to the Technological field:</h2>
            <p>This website gives information of Grace Hopper's history by integrating the inputs mentioned in the part 1 coursework and applying the knowledge gained through our lectures.</p>
                <h3>CM1102: Web Development - part 1 (To build a static website using HTML and CSS)</h3>
                <p>The project is given to test our skills and understanding of the lessons taught during our lectures. The successful running of my web page should prove that we have learnt our topics properly and are able to make a static web browser page on the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>On a person: their contributions and information</li>
                        <li>On technology made which has some importance</li>
                    </ol>
                    As I have chosen to make it on a person: Grace Brewster Hopper, the web page is expected to have the following:
                    <ul>
                            <li>Information about the person (e.g. his or her personal background)</li>
                            <li>A discussion about the technological contribution he or she has made</li>
                            <li>A discussion on why this technological contribution is still relevant today</li>
                    </ul>
            <p>The webpage divided into sections as links to help navigate required information about <em>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</em>:</p>
