            <h1>COBOL: Relevance in the present day scenario</h1>
            <p>COmmon Business Oriented Language or in short, COBOL, a 63 year old language, is one of the high level languages that was made by the department of defense, U.S.A with the motive to develop a common language to be used for computer programming. COBOL's advanced file handling capabilities enable it to handle huge volumes of data.
               The group that made COBOL, came to be named as CODASYL- the Committee on Data Systems Languagesâ€”and defined a "common business oriented language," drawing from Grace Hopper's FLOW-MATIC, and other languages including Univac's AIMACO and IBM's COMTRAN.
               Throughtout the years, this language went through loads of updates and changes, but still remains to dominate the building business systems.

            <h2>The current day scenario: usage and statistics</h2>
            <p>Prominent corporations such as IBM, UPS, and CIGNA continue to leverage COBOL in their operations. Users of this programming language underscore its user-friendly nature, particularly for non-programmers and business professionals. The prevailing trend in COBOL application management leans heavily towards modernization, with 64 percent of respondents expressing a preference for this strategy over complete replacement. Additionally, 72 percent regard modernization as a comprehensive business strategy.</p>
            <p>The role of cloud technology is pivotal in propelling the modernization of applications. In a survey regarding their companies' plans for COBOL and the cloud in 2021, 43 percent of respondents indicated that their COBOL applications currently support or will support the cloud by the end of the year. Furthermore, 41 percent highlighted the necessity of integrating new business projects with existing COBOL systems.</p>
            <p>As of 2019, the TIOBE index ranked COBOL as the 24th most popular language among the top 50, a position that rose to 15th by August 2023. A survey sponsored by IT company Micro Focus and conducted by research firm Vanson Bourne estimated a daily usage of between 775-850 billion lines of COBOL code. Notably, 92 percent of users consider COBOL strategically important. According to Reuters, a publicly owned international news company established in London in 1851, 95 percent of ATM cards still rely on COBOL code. COBOL manages transactions totaling 3 trillion dollars (approximately 2 trillion 390 billion pounds) in commerce every day.</p>
            <p>Moreover, several universities are incorporating COBOL into their curriculum to support application modernization and the DevOps movement.</p>
            <h2>How COVID-19 created a demand of COBOL users:</h2>
            <p>Before Java became the standard for servers, COBOL was the language of choice for mainframes.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought attention to the gap between computer history and contemporary application development. Numerous government programs, such as those for unemployment or emergency loans, necessitate interactions with legacy COBOL systems. Often, these interactions are initiated through integration with server-side Java-based programs.</p>
            <p>By incorporating Java into the mix while acquiring a foundational understanding of COBOL, one can effectively address the increasing demand for interfacing with older environments.</p>
            <p>The demand for COBOL programmers remains robust. A search for "COBOL Developer" yielded 568 job listings on Indeed.com. Compensation for COBOL developers ranges from $40 to well over $100 per hour.</p>
            <p>"It's straightforward to grasp COBOL, but it's certainly not regarded as enjoyable," remarked Monte Zweben, CEO of Splice Machine. Some of his students utilize COBOL in their daily roles at institutions like the Royal Bank of Scotland, which heavily relies on COBOL for its banking applications. Consequently, COBOL's basic syntax incorporates instructions reminiscent of the English language. While mastering COBOL basics proves uncomplicated, the real challenge lies in deciphering code that may have remained untouched for many years or even decades, employing undocumented logic and features. Heirloom Computing has developed cloud-native tools capable of automatically recompiling COBOL applications into Java. However, enterprises must still undertake the provisioning of their legacy Oracle, DB2, IMC databases, or VSAM files to more contemporary alternatives.</p>
