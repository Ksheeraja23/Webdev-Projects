            <h1>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper: The talented "COBOL Grandma"</h1>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg/384px-Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg" alt="Grace Brewster Hopper">
           <p>Grace Brewster Hopper was a standout figure who excelled in various fields. She was not only a skilled American computer scientist but also a mathematician and a rear admiral in the United States Navy. Known for her early work as a programmer for the Harvard Mark I computer, she even played a role in creating one of the first linkers.
              Hopper's contributions go beyond just coding - she came up with the idea of programming languages that could work on different machines. The programming language she developed, FLOW-MATIC, paved the way for COBOL, a significant early programming language still used today.
              Even as a kid, Hopper showed a fascination with engineering by taking apart and putting back together household items. Little did her family know that this early interest would lead to her gaining recognition at the highest levels.
              As one of the first modern programmers, Hopper left a lasting impact on computer languages. She was known for her sharp mind, bold personality, and groundbreaking work in both the U.S. Navy and the private sector.
